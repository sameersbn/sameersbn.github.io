Hello and welcome to my blog.

My name is **Sameer Naik** and I work as a software developer in **Bangalore, India**. I go by the handle **sameersbn** on [Twitter](//twitter.com/sameersbn) and [GitHub](//github.com/sameersbn).

On this blog I will share my experience as a software developer, talk about opensource projects, docker and other interesting stuff.

I hope you find my posts useful in some way or the other and share them with your friends.
